    <h1>Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>
    <img class="reasonable-img" src="spaghetti-bolognese.jpg" style="max-width: 300px;">
    <p>Spaghetti is a classic "lazy dish" that honestly takes a little more work than most
        people give it credit for. However, if you're careful and follow the recipe, you 
        don't have to be an Emeril Lagazzi or a Gordon Ramsay to make good, down-home 
        spaghetti.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti (dried)</li>
        <li>Ground meat</li>
        <li>Onions (diced)</li>
        <li>Garlic (freshly minced)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First, take the slices of bread and put them on a plate or cutting board.</li>
        <li>Next, if you will use mayo or mustard on your sandwich, spread the condiment in a thin later (to taste) on the slives of bread.</li>
        <li>After that, place slices of ham onto the open-faced sandwich (to taste).</li>
        <li>Finally, unite the two sides of the sandwich into on completed sandwich.</li>
        <li>Optional: Slice the sandwich from one corner to the opposite corner to make sandwich triangles, the superior way to consume a sandwich.</li>
    </ol>
